# Contributing

We welcome improvements, extensions, bug reports and bug fixes to `bam-readcount`!  

## Bug Reports
To make bug reports most useful, please include:
- a brief summary of the problem - what did you expect, and what actually happened?
- precise steps to reproduce the problem, and a minimal bam/cram file on which the steps can be run, if possible.

## Fixes or Feature Additions
Direct pull requests are just fine - fork the repository, create an new branch, then make a PR against this repo.

Before investing time and effort, it is often best to create an issue in 
the github repository reporting the bug and/or proposing the change, and we'll be happy to discuss the 
details and feasibility with you.
